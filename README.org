* Introduction
In this document we will explain the basic features of our prototype
  implementation for the paper /Automatic generation of schematic
  travel-time maps for multi-modal transportation/.  The focus will be
  set on how to use to code to generate your own travel-time maps for
  the given example data.
** Disclaimer 
   This software is only a prototype implementation and as such can
   contain bugs and is not yet designed for everyday usage. In
   particular, the software is not optimized regarding memory and RAM
   usage. We recommend at least 6 GB of RAM for using theq
   software. If you encounter any bugs or have feedback on the
   implementation feel free to contact me using [[mailto:forsch@igg.uni-bonn.de][E-Mail]].

* Using the code
** Setup
The code is written in Java and structured into four *Project Jigsaw*
modules:
- 1) =de.unibonn.geoinfo.isochrones= :: this module is the heart of the
     implementation and contains all the algorithms for calculating
     travel-times and visualizing time zones.
- 2) =de.unibonn.geoinfo.gisviewer= :: this module contains a /Java Swing/
     GUI for displaying maps, we use this to display the results of
     the algorithms
- 3) =de.unibonn.geoinfo.ipeio= :: this module contains code for
     importing and exporting [[http://ipe.otfried.org/][Ipe]] files into the java programm (this is
     used for creating small debug examples)
- 4) =de.unibonn.geoinfo.util= :: this module contains utility functions
     such as data structures and coorinate transformations
To compile these classes, please refer to the [[https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/][Project Jigsaw webpage]].
Alternatively, a pre-compiled jar-file is included in the documents.

** Running the code
The source code contains the class =main.Main.java= which serves as the
main class for running the code. The behavior of the program is
controlled by command line arguments passed to this main class or the
pre-compiled jar-file.  To run the program, navigate to the directory
containing =traveltimes.jar= and execute the following comand:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar traveltimes.jar -dr [path-to-road-shp] -dg [path-to-gtfs-dir] -s [id-of-startnode]
#+END_SRC

Shown are the three mandatory input parameters =-dr=, =-dg= and =-s= used to
specify the path to the input data and the node index of the starting
node in the road network for the travel-time map. To retrieve the node
index for a specific location you have two options: the first option
utilizes the GUI, for this leave away parameter =-s= and add parameter
=-r= to shows the GUI without calculating a time-zone. Clicking on a
location on the map displays the node index of the closest road node
in the top left corner of the frame. The second option is to enter the
coordinates of desired starting points in a csv-file with each line
formatted as =x,y=, passing the file with parameter =-f=. Here is an
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /home/axel/Documents/002_Isochrones/travel-time_maps/docs/documentation/ :exports both :results output
  java -jar traveltimes.jar -dr ./data/03_roadBornheim/BornheimUTM.shp -dg ./data/03_gtfsBornheim -f ./data/start_locations.csv
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Searching node indices:
:   node not found
:   found 27291

Note that only nodes in a radius of 15 meters around the specified
location are returned. For the given example the first location does
not yield a valid node. To start a query from the second node, use =-s
27291=.

To enable the GUI to show results, use the flag =-r=. Otherwise results
can only be inspected by opening the output files created.

* Important classes and methods 
In the previous, we explained how the class =Main.java= could be used to
run the tool. In this section we will explain the basic structure of
the tool by presenting the most important classes and functions.
** IsochroneCreator
   The class =isochrone.IsochroneCreator.java= makes up the heart of the
   tool, combining all steps needed for creating a travel-time map
   with multiple time-zones. On initialization, all relevant data is
   loaded and the preprocessing step, must importantly the
   planarization step, is performed.  The method
   =createIsochrone(startid, starttime, time, bufferTime, fatory)= can
   then be called repeatedly to create time-zones for different
   starting locations and travel-times.  To check the results, the
   method =validateResult(timezone, coloredGraph)= can be used to check
   if the time-zone correctly covers all reachable points of the road
   network. This is done by an extensive point-in-polygon-search.  In
   the following, we will explain what exactly is done in the method
   =createIsochrone=.
** MultiModalRouter
   The class =graph.routing.MultiModalRouter= performs Step 1 of the
   creation of isochrones as explained in the Introduction of our
   paper, the calculation of the reachable part of the road network.
   On creation, this class combines the road data with the public
   transportation data to one routing graph. The method =route(startid,
   starttime, time, buffertime, stopwatch)= then performs a query,
   storing the result in a colored graph.
** Planarizer
   The class =graph.planarizer.Planarizer= performs the planarization
   step of the road graph.
** NodeInserter
   The class =graph.planarizer.NodeInserter= is used to insert the /port/
   nodes into the graph: the =MultiModalRouter= colors all nodes of the
   original road graph. In general, upon reaching these nodes, some
   travel time is left. The =NodeInserter= splits /gate/ arcs to insert
   precise port nodes.
** FaceIdentifier
   The class =isochrone.FaceIdentifier= is used to identify the outer
   faces of colored components. These are the faces where the grid is
   calculated on to create the octilinear polygons.
** IsoFace
   An =isochrone.IsoFace= represents a single face of the planar graph
   and is used to calculate the visualization grid. Each visualization
   type needs a class extending the =IsoFace= which defines how the grid
   is created.
** IsoMap
   The =isochrone.IsoMap= is used to join all the =IsoFace= objects of a
   component to create a time-zone. This class contains the method
   =route(coloredGraph, factory, stopwatch)= which calculates the
   minimum-bend path to enclose a component.

This list of classes and methods gives only a small overview over the
most important functionalities of the tool. For a better understanding
on how the tool works, refer to our publication.

** Rendered examples
In addition to the source code, we included four rendered examples of travel-time maps in /pdf/ and /png/ format; see [[file:./fig/]]. These maps are created for three timezones of temporal extend 10, 20 and 30 minutes, starting from 4 different starting locations in the experimental region.
To enhance the visualizsation, the clipping extension has been applied to the map of [[file:fig/Porz.png][Porz]] and [[file:fig/Westhoven.png][Westhoven]]. No other extension have been used.
